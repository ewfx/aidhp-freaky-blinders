## 💡 Inspiration
In today's fast-paced digital era, banks present a myriad of products—credit cards, debit cards, loans, and more—making it challenging for users to identify the ideal choice for their needs. Meanwhile, marketing teams often face the task of repeatedly reaching out to customers to promote these offerings. To simplify decision-making and empower users with tailored choices, we are developing an AI-driven recommendation engine designed to cut through the confusion and deliver the perfect solution effortlessly.
